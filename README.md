# Introduction 

 In my design course assignment I chose to design Square eyes, so now in this assignment I have used HTML and CSS to code the website. 

 # Index page 

I did some changes on my index/login page. In my first design I had the buttons in the end of the hero section and the h1 in the start, but I thought it looked better and less empty when I centered all the items. 

 # Form page 

In the form page my biggest issue was that the input type “submit” button didn’t link to my success page, and I didn’t figure out how to fix this without changing it to an anchor tag instead, so that is why it is an a href in my form instead.  

 # Success page 

This was probably the easiest page for me to code. Didn't really face any major issues here. 

 # Movie page 

This was the first time I tried out media queries. I didn’t understand much of it in the start, but then I changes some of my code to fit a mobile screen instead of laptop, and then put laptop size inside the @media.  

That worked well for me, and I think next time I code I will start by coding the mobile size screen, and change it to laptop using min-width in with media queries. 

On this page I also changed my design and centered everything because I thought it looked empty when I had the top movies to the right. 

In my design I had some scrolling elements on the movies, but I didn’t manage to figure out how to do this in time, so unfortunately my website doesn’t have all the movies that I was planning. 

I made all the watch-now buttons as buttons tag, except the one I wanted to link to the product page. On that one I used an anchor tag to link it. If every buttons was supposed to link, I would have used an anchor tag on everyone. I probably should have done it anyway just for the practice.  

 #Product page 

 Didn't have many issues on this page either. I used media queries for the text to go underneath the picture on mobile screen, and for the icons to go under “movies” and “shows”. That was also a change I did in my design. I originally had the icon of a hamburger menu, but the only content I had was “movies” and “shows”, so I felt like it was unnecessary to make that. 

 # About page 

My problem with this page is that the picture gets cropped so much the smaller you go, so you can’t really see what the picture is on mobile. This still annoys me, and I didn’t figure out how to fix this. 

 # Conclusion 

I feel like I’m getting better and better at coding the more I do it, so I am really looking forward to the next project and think I have some good ideas. The one major thing I'm taking with me to the next project is to make the mobile size first in CSS, and then add media queries to make it responsive on all screens. For me I think that makes much more sense. 

I had to make some changes on the design when I was coding because I thought It looked better. I tried to make the same changes in both Figma and on the website. 

Overall I had fun doing the project. I started early before we had finished all our classes, so I had to make some changes to the code on the way.
